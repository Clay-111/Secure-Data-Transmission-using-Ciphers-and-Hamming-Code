# Secure Data Transmission using Ciphers and Hamming Code

This project demonstrates secure data transmission using the Affine Cipher for encryption, Hamming Code for error detection and correction, and NRZ (Non-Return-to-Zero) encoding for signal representation.

## Features

- **Affine Cipher Encryption and Decryption**:
  - Encrypts plaintext using the Affine Cipher.
  - Decrypts ciphertext back to plaintext after error correction.

- **Binary Conversion**:
  - Converts the ciphertext into binary format for further processing.

- **NRZ Encoding**:
  - Implements NRZ-I (Non-Return-to-Zero Inverted) and NRZ-L (Non-Return-to-Zero Level) encoding.
  - Plots the encoded signals for visualization.

- **Hamming Code**:
  - Encodes binary data using Hamming Code for error detection and correction.
  - Detects and corrects single-bit errors in the received data.
